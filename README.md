Tippie
=====================

Porting over my old [Android Tippie app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsadwick.tips) to html5/js.
I'm doing more than just porting, Tippie is getting a total revamp and a better UI.

**Features**

- Calculate tips on the fly.
- Split the bill.
- Email breakdown of meal to others.
- Save and load tips for later (reference to receipt = no more paper!).
- Rating system: use a rating system to easily come up with a tip.
- Easily customize rating to tip ratio.

**Dependencies**

- [Sass](https://github.com/nex3/sass)
- [Compass](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass)
- [Gumby](https://github.com/GumbyFramework/gumby)
- [jQuery Mobile](http://jquery.com/)
